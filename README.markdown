the probability of A tag given B triple is

probability of B triple given A tag *
probability of A tag

over

probability of B triple






need to be able to look up

* total number of articles seen

* for any given triple, how many articles include that triple
  
* for any given tag, how many articles include that tag
  
* for any given tag, how many times any given triple occurs

* for any given a triple, a set of tags that have occurred for that triple

initially, look up the total set of tags for all the triples ...
